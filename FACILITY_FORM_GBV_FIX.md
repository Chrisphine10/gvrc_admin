# Facility Form GBV Categories Fix

## Issue Description
The **GBV Categories** dropdown in the facility create form was not showing any options, making it impossible for users to select GBV categories for facilities.

## Root Cause
The `GBVCategory` lookup table in the database was completely empty (0 records), so the form had no options to display in the dropdown.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Populated GBV Categories Table**
Created 15 comprehensive GBV categories based on international standards:

- **Intimate Partner Violence** - Physical, sexual, or psychological harm by current/former partners
- **Sexual Violence** - Any sexual act using coercion
- **Child Marriage** - Marriage where parties are under 18
- **Female Genital Mutilation** - Non-medical removal of external female genitalia
- **Human Trafficking** - Recruitment and exploitation of persons
- **Economic Violence** - Deprivation of economic resources and opportunities
- **Psychological Violence** - Emotional abuse, threats, intimidation
- **Stalking** - Repeated unwanted attention and harassment
- **Honor-based Violence** - Violence to protect/restore family honor
- **Technology-facilitated Violence** - Cyberstalking and online harassment
- **LGBTQ+ Violence** - Violence based on sexual orientation/gender identity
- **Disability-based Violence** - Violence targeting individuals with disabilities
- **Elder Abuse** - Physical, sexual, emotional, or financial abuse of older adults
- **Workplace Violence** - Violence, harassment, or intimidation at work
- **Educational Violence** - Violence, harassment, or discrimination in education

### 2. **Populated Other Lookup Tables**
Also populated related lookup tables to ensure complete form functionality:

#### **Service Categories (10 options)**
- Medical Services, Counseling & Support, Legal Aid, Shelter & Housing
- Education & Training, Economic Empowerment, Child Protection
- Community Outreach, Emergency Response, Rehabilitation

#### **Owner Types (8 options)**
- Government, NGO, Faith-Based Organization, Private Sector
- Community-Based Organization, International Organization
- Academic Institution, Healthcare Provider

#### **Contact Types (6 options)**

### 3. **Database Status After Fix**
```
